## Language Redirector Overview

If you've ever developed a multilingual website, you've probably thought about automatically redirecting your visitors to their preferred language. While it may have sounded simple at first, you obviously eventually realised it wasn't. Indeed, you have to take quite a few parameters into account:
- The Sites defined in Craft
- The languages used in your Sites
- The language chosen in the language switcher
- The language(s) accepted by your visitor's browser
- Whether the Entry exists in the target language

Language Redirector mixes all these parameters and provides you with an easy-to-implement solution.

## Configuring Language Redirector

By default, Language Redirector will use all of your defined sites as the site/language combinations to redirect visitors.  If you wish to override the defaults (to say rename or remove a site), you can:

1. Copy the config.php file provided at the root of the plugin directory to the `config` folder of your Craft install.
2. Name it `language-redirector.php`.
3. Assign sites to languages in the `languages` array, either using their handle or their ID. For example: `'en' => 'english'` or `'fr' => 5`. Don't forget that the configuration file is multi-environment friendy, just like any other Craft config file.

If you feel like it, you can also rename the URL query parameter name and the session key. By default, they are both set to 'lang'.
